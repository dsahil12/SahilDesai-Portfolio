# General Government Debt Overview

It is the gross debt of the general government expressed as a percentage of GDP. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories where applicable: currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. This indicator serves as a key measure of the sustainability of government finance, with changes in government debt over time primarily reflecting the impact of past government deficits.

## Part One: Working with Web-Based Visualization Tools and Data

I downloaded this image from the oecd.org site, which enabled me to manipulate and display the data in a user-friendly format. The main objective was to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within the dataset.

For this part of the assignment, I used web-based visualization tools to analyze data on general government debt across various countries. The visualization, titled **General government debt**, provides a clear representation of the debt levels, expressed as a percentage of GDP, for different nations. The data highlights the comparative debt burdens and allows for insights into how economic policies and fiscal management vary globally.

## Working with Tableau

# Tableau Visualization

To view the Tableau visualization, [click here](https://dsahil12.github.io/SahilDesai-Portfolio/tableau-viz.html).

Alternatively, you can try embedding it directly below:

_A reminder that to get the Tableau visualization to render correctly on Github, you'll have to do a bit of editing of the code block once you paste it here.  As before, make sure to walk us through what you did in Tableau, and any thoughts or observations, etc._

## Part three: create your own visualization

_Create another data visualization using the same data used earlier. DO NOT submit something that's just a minor modification of one of the visualizations already covered here. So, don't just modify the colors or labels of one of the earlier examples and call it good, or submit a slightly modified bar chart.  Instead, see what you can come up with on your own, and spend some time to try and create something that tells a story about the data._

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work.  Could someone follow your process and understand what you did?  Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text?  Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_
