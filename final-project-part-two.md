# Dashboard / Storyboards
> The dashboard provides an overview of Etihad Airways' current strategy for managing its United States market. It focuses on three main aspects: U.S. route density, fleet expansion, and market opportunities in key global regions. Each visual on this dashboard conveys critical insights about Etihad's current operations and future growth areas as it expects 15 new Airbus A350s (long-haul aircraft).

> Overall, it serves as a strategic guide for Etihad's decision-makers (CEO, Network Planners, Business Strategist). It acts as a landing page highlighting Etihad's positioning compared to some of its direct competitors, Emirates and Qatar Airways, in key U.S. hubs, opportunities to expand fleet capabilities, and the potential to connect U.S. cities with high-demand markets in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Overall, it helps the airline team plan to make decisions to meet demand and strengthen its presence in the regions.

# User research 

## Target audience
> The three primary audiences for this dashboard include:
Etihad executives and leadership committee which is responsible for making strategic decisions on market expansion and fleet investments. Then, we have route planning and network strategy teams that focus on route optimization, flight frequency, and identifying growth opportunities. Lastly, we have business strategist that are interested in evaluating fleet expansion to the best optimal routs and assessing resource allocation for profitability.

## Goal
>The goal is to inform Etihad's leadership about its strategic positioning in the U.S. market, how it should make fleet allocation decisions, and help prioritize route expansion plans with its new aircraft to maximize market potential.  Thus, looking at route density, fleet strategy, and regional demand, the goal is to identify optimal areas for growth and make Etihad competitive against other leading Middle Eastern carriers.


## Interview Objective
>The interviews aim to get feedback from executives or senior leadership, network planners, and different types of analysts regarding the dashboard's effectiveness and usability in supporting strategic decision-making.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Assess understanding and clarity of dashboard visuals      |How easy was it for you to understand the information presented in each visual?                  |
|Evaluate the relevance of information for decision-making      |Would you need additional data or another visual to help your decision-making process?                  |
|Determine the effectiveness of insights on fleet Expansion plan and route optimization      |How effective is the visual showing flight density across U.S. hubs in helping you understand where to prioritize additional routes or connections?                  |
|Understand the usability and actionability of the dashboard      |Do you think this dashboard helps identify actionable areas for growth, such as key hubs to target or regions with untapped demand?                  |
|Collect suggestions for improvement     |Is there anything you found confusing or that could be improved for better understanding?                  |

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Product Manager) | Interview 2 (Route Planner) | Interview 3 (Analyst) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How easy was it for you to understand the information presented in each visual?	 | The new color schemes are much more intuitive, but it suggested adding brief explanations for specific terms like fleet expansion.  |To improve labels and filter instructions, which are helpful for quickly understanding the data.   |The numerical labels on the visuals are useful, making interpreting the data without ambiguity easier.  |
|Would you need additional data or another visual to help your decision-making process?                         |Suggested adding a visual comparing competitor airlines' market share trends for better benchmarking.                   |Recommended to make it dynamic by adding a new filter by airline type useful, but recommended visual comparing load factors across different routes.             |Appreciated the inclusion of comparative seat capacity but suggested adding more financial projections related to ROI on new aircraft investments.             |
|Do you think this dashboard helps identify actionable areas for growth, such as key hubs to target or regions with untapped demand?	                         |Yes, particularly with the added action items section, which clarified specific growth areas.	                                |Found the growth summary section very helpful in identifying new routes and underutilized hubs for expansion.             |Emphasized that adding a financial summary (e.g., projected revenue increase by region) would improve actionability.             |
|Is there anything you found confusing or that could be improved for better understanding?       |The seating capacity visual legend could be more distinct.             |Recommended adding a glossary for certain technical terms.             |Found no major issues but suggested adding a time-series filter to analyze data over different periods to spot trends. |


# Identified changes for Part III
> After conducting three interviews, I identified a couple of insights, and it seems like developing a new interactive and simpler dashboard.


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Color Scheme and Clarity |Further refine color schemes for improved user experience across different types of devices. Add legends for certain elements.|                                          
|Relevance of Information                                             |Adding financial context related to fleet expansion, while the route planner wanted the ability to compare aircraft types for route efficiency.|                |Route Optimization Analysis                                                                                 |Add a growth potential metric to prioritize route expansion decisions better. Incorporate trend lines or historical data for profitability comparisons.|                                          |                                                                                 |
|Highlighting Competitive Hubs	           |Expand on competitive hub analysis by including more detailed annotations and comparative metrics for each key hub.|
|Interactive Filters for Comparison	    |Introduce an interactive filter that allows side-by-side comparisons between Etihad and its competitors, making benchmarking easier and more actionable.     |
|Interactive Filters for Comparison	    |Add a visual to show the capacity of each aircraft type in the fleet and its average daily utilization to provide more context on operational efficiency.     |

Final Thoughts: The planned changes for Part III focus on enhancing interactivity, adding detailed financial and growth metrics, and improving user understanding. It also closely compares itself with some of its competitors regarding its aircraft fleet. Thus, on top of the landing page, I plan to add a dashboard to answer detailed analysis questions.
