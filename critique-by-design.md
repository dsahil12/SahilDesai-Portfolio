# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Results: 



| Question | Interview 1 (Student, Mid-20’s) | Interview 2 (Adult, Early-30’s) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|What’s your first impression of this visualization?          |I can tell it’s showing how different sectors are compared in terms of brand value. The title, Top 9 Sectors by Value, clearly indicates the focus, and the bar chart layout makes it easy to understand. I immediately knew I was looking at ranked data with each sector represented by a different colored bar.             |It’s straightforward to follow. The bar chart format is familiar, so I can quickly tell it’s comparing sectors by brand value. You’ve done a “good job simplifying the data.”             |

|          |             |             |

**Synthesis:**

Based on interviews, I identified that the visual needs a cleaner and more simplified version, which is less cluttered in design. They emphasized simplifying the color scheme and remodeling the visual by moving the labels more efficiently, such as moving sector names outside the bars. 

Additionally, the x-axis title ($USD Billions) should be removed, and dollar signs should be incorporated into the values. This feedback indicates that the final redesign should focus on clarity, minimizing visual clutter, and making the data more accessible for professionals to interpret at a glance.

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
