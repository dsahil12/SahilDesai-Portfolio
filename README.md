Hello! My name is **Sahil Desai** (he/him), and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, with a concentration in Product Management. I have a strong foundation in product strategy, data analysis, and market research, backed by hands-on experience in global product marketing and software solutions. My journey so far has equipped me with skills in launching products, driving business growth, and leveraging data to make strategic decisions.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work in diverse roles, where I spearheaded initiatives that improved market share, product adoption, and customer satisfaction. I am passionate about creating impactful products that address real user needs. I am excited to continue my journey in the tech industry, focusing on roles that blend product management and data-driven decision-making.

## What I hope to learn
1. 1. Understand how design elements like color, type, and visual style impact how viewers perceive and interpret data.
2. 2. Learn effective techniques for presenting complex data clearly and compellingly to support storytelling and decision-making.
3. 3. Explore new tools and methodologies for data visualization, enhancing my skills in product management and data-driven insights.
