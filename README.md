# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for **Telling Stories with Data** at CMU! Here's where all my cool work will go. You should probably hire me.

## About me

Hello! My name is **Sahil Desai** (he/him), and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, with a concentration in Product Management. I have a strong foundation in product strategy, data analysis, and market research, backed by hands-on experience in global product marketing and software solutions. My journey so far has equipped me with skills in launching products, driving business growth, and leveraging data to make strategic decisions.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work in diverse roles, where I spearheaded initiatives that improved market share, product adoption, and customer satisfaction. I am passionate about creating impactful products that address real user needs. I am excited to continue my journey in the tech industry, focusing on roles that blend product management and data-driven decision-making.

## What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things. If so, I can do so in Markdown like this:

1. Understand how design elements like color, type, and visual style impact how viewers perceive and interpret data.
2. Learn effective techniques for presenting complex data clearly and compellingly to support storytelling and decision-making.
3. Explore new tools and methodologies for data visualization, enhancing my skills in product management and data-driven insights.

## Portfolio

### Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page. This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`. For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension.

### Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page. This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.

### Final Project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

- [Part I: Project Proposal](final-project-part-one)
- [Part II: Data Analysis and Visualization Development](final-project-part-two)
- [Part III: Final Presentation and Reflections](final-project-part-three)

### Additional Examples
This section can be used to include examples from in-class demos, other work, or personal projects related to data visualization and storytelling.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
