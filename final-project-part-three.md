>To drill down further, we have a dynamic dashboard (dashboard 2) that compares Etihad’s flight network and capacity across major U.S. destinations, positioning Etihad against Emirates and Qatar Airways. This particular dashboard is made with the primary users (leadership) in mind, as it has minimal visuals and a major focus on displaying values. Overall, the dashboard offers interactive features to compare route coverage, flight frequency, and aircraft utilization across the “Big Three” airlines in the Middle East. It also highlights where Etihad can enhance its network to gain a competitive edge.

# Changes made since Part I & II
Since completing Part I, I made a few changes based on the instructor's feedback. I incorporated additional data sources to enhance the analysis, allowing for a more comprehensive comparison between Etihad and its competitors. These additional sources helped enrich the narrative by providing broader insights into regional traffic and Etihad's current fleet capacities. The integration of this new data has been updated in Part I's documentation with a short description. 

Next, in Part II, the focus was on refining and expanding the initial dashboard based on user research findings and feedback. The dashboard in part II was designed to showcase a broad range of data that targeted various audiences. Thus, I transformed it into a landing page that serves as a high-level overview for decision-makers at Etihad Airways. This static dashboard landing page provides immediate insights into U.S. market opportunities and fleet allocation. 

I reduced the number of visuals based on user interviews, emphasizing key KPIs and direct comparability. Key changes included:
- **Simplifying Dashboards**: We now have two main dashboards. One provides an overview of U.S. operations, and the other focuses on flight network insights for leadership.
- **Single Filter for Comparisons**: Added an easy-to-use filter for side-by-side comparison with competitors.
- **Actionable KPIs**: Highlighted key KPIs and metrics, such as flight frequency by hub, to support quick strategic decision-making in the new dashboard.

Overall, the dashboard evolved from a broad analysis tool to a targeted decision-making asset tailored to the needs of Etihad’s leadership.

## The audience
> Dashboard 1

The landing page dashboard, titled **Overview of Etihad’s U.S. Operations, Fleet Expansion, and Market Potential**, is designed specifically for strategy developers at Etihad Airways. This audience includes senior route planners, market strategists, and those responsible for analyzing growth opportunities. The landing page offers a broad, high-level overview of Etihad’s current U.S. market footprint, fleet expansion plans, and regional market potential. The visuals provide insights into flight density at key U.S. hubs, fleet growth strategy, and the importance of connecting U.S. hubs to major international regions such as Asia-Pacific and Europe. The dashboards visualize and support strategy development by focusing on growth opportunities and competitive positioning without overwhelming users with unnecessary details.

> Dashboard 2

The detailed breakdown dashboard, **Flight Network and Capacity Insights**, targets Etihad’s senior decision-makers, including the CEO and the leadership board. It provides a more detailed look into Etihad’s operational metrics, such as seat capacity, route coverage, flight frequency, and comparisons to major competitors. Knowing that leadership prefers quick, actionable insights, this dashboard focuses on key performance indicators and includes an easy-to-use filter for comparing metrics across competitors. The goal of making this dashboard a highly functional decision-support tool is to provide the leadership team with precise data to inform fleet allocation and market expansion strategies.
